<h1>Chipster web-server</h1>
<p>This is Chipster web-server. It is a simple web server for serving the files of 
the client app. It has no purpose in a development installation, where you want to serve the 
client files with <kbd>ng serve</kbd> (by default in port 4200). In a server installation you should replace this file with compiled
client files in the <kbd>web-root</kbd> directory (served by default in port 8000).</p>
